<p>With an abundance of things to make, why spend your time working on anything except only the things that need to exist?</p>

<p>If you have come across this site, I would love your help in discovering which one of my ideas should exist. Vote on ideas you see on this site that you would like to see exist in the world. You can vote as many times as you want.</p>

<p>If you get inspired to share your own ideas that you feel should exist, you can even add your ideas.</p>
